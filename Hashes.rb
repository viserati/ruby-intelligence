A hash is a dictionary surrounded by curly braces. Dictionaries match words
with their definitions. Ruby does so with a hash rocket =>.
Unlike arrays, the items in a hash are not kept in a specific order.

{:key => value} # Think key/value pair.

{:sw => 'southwest_airlines', aa => 'american_airlines', ua => 'united_airlines'}

{ 'Parrot' => 'Bird',
  'Polly' => 'Parrot',
  'Bird' => 'fly'
}

# The most important thing to remember about hashes is that you use keys to
# set or retrieve values.
